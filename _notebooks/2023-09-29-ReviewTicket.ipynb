    "    <h1>Data Types</h1>\n",
    "    <p>The project consisted of creating an object with attributes name, age, classes, interests, favorite_songs, id_num, num_games, and num_wins. The number of games and wins is considering our plan for the passion project, a game (considering connect 4) that also supports chatting. For the attributes, I added an array for my interests in order to show a list of interests instead of a single one. Same thing for favorite_songs. The id_num is for verifying an account because we are planning on creating a database for users. This will keep track of the number of games as well as the number of wins. I have also added a calculation code that calculates the total win percentage.</p>\n",
    "    <h2>Errors</h2>\n",
    "    <p>Tried to implement classes into JS but always resulted in error.</p>\n",
    "    <p>The classes weren't working but the objects were.</p>\n",
    "    <h1>DOM: Message Switcher</h1>\n",
    "    <h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
    "    <p>The \"Message Switcher\" is a simple yet visually engaging web page that demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to dynamically switch messages when a button is clicked. The page includes a button and a paragraph with an initial message, and it utilizes basic styling and animations to make the experience more appealing.</p>\n",
    "    <h2>HTML Structure</h2>\n",
    "    <p>The HTML structure of the page is minimal, comprising essential elements:</p>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li><button id=\"switchButton\">Switch Message</button>: This button triggers the message switching action.</li>\n",
    "        <li><p id=\"status\">Not Switched</p>: This paragraph initially displays the message \"Not Switched\" and will be dynamically updated with new messages.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <h2>JavaScript Functionality</h2>\n",
    "    <p>The JavaScript code adds interactivity to the web page:</p>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Function switchMessage:</strong> This function is called when the \"Switch Message\" button is clicked. It performs the following tasks:</li>\n",
    "        <ol>\n",
    "            <li>Defines an array of positive messages like \"Nice Switching!\", \"Not Very Useful!\", \"Funni Prank!\", and \"Why did I make this!\".</li>\n",
    "            <li>Randomly selects a new message from the array that is different from the current message.</li>\n",
    "            <li>Applies the \"switchAnimation\" to animate the message switching.</li>\n",
    "            <li>Updates the \"status\" paragraph with the new message.</li>\n",
    "        </ol>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Button Event Listener:</strong> An event listener is added to the \"switchButton\" element. When the button is clicked, it triggers the switchMessage function, resulting in the dynamic message switch (DOM).</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <h2>User Experience</h2>\n",
    "    <p>When a user visits this web page and clicks the \"Switch Message\" button, they experience an engaging transition. The message is not only changed but also animated with a scaling and fade-in/fade-out effect, making the message switch visually appealing.</p>\n",
    "    <p>This simple yet effective demonstration showcases the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive and engaging web pages. The \"Message Switcher\" can serve as a starting point for more complex web applications or as an interesting addition to any website.</p>\n",
    "    <h1>Javascript</h1>\n",
    "    <p>We added a function that takes in two arguments. These will be the score of one player and the score of another. This is for our later project where we will have a scoring system where the player with the highest score wins. The Tic Tac Toe game is a simpler version for the future connect 4 game. This is because we have user interaction where it also has a simple visual representation. This code doesn't contain any actual visual attributes but for the passion project, we want to create a custom interface. Also, the tic tac toe uses similar logic to the one of connect 4, therefore it is a good way of preparing for the passion project.</p>\n",

    "    <h1>HTML</h1>\n",
    "    <p>I decided to follow the hacks, but experiment with different links with the href attribute, but explore further by developing a dark mode button that toggles the dark mode of the webpage. I experimented with CSS to make the button look nicer, also to change the color of text, make a hover animation and so on. I stole the base code from header.html, in order to make my dark mode button appear on every webpage. The Tic Tac Toe game is a simpler version for the future connect 4 game.
