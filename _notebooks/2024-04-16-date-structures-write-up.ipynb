    "> Discuss concepts and understanding of Linear Regression algorithms.\n",
    "- Linear regression is like drawing a straight line through points on a graph. Imagine you have some data points scattered on a graph, and you want to find a line that best fits through them. This line helps you predict what the value of one thing (like a person's height) might be based on another thing (like their weight). If you have just one thing helping you predict, it's called simple linear regression, but if you have more things, it's called multiple linear regression. The goal is to find the line that's closest to all the points. This line has a slope (how steep it is) and an intercept (where it crosses the y-axis). We use math to figure out these values, making sure the line is as close to all the points as possible. Once we have this line, we can use it to make predictions or understand the relationship between the two things we're interested in. It helps to predict hings such as death probability (as seen in the Titanic model).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Discuss concepts and understanding of Decision Tree analysis algorithms.\n",
    "- Decision trees are like flowcharts for making decisions based on data. Each node in the tree represents a decision based on a feature, leading to more decisions or predictions. The top node is the initial decision, and as you move down, you encounter decisions based on other features until you reach a conclusion. Algorithms like CART or ID3 help build these trees by finding the best features to split the data. While decision trees are easy to understand and interpret, they can overfit the data, so techniques like pruning or using ensemble methods like random forests help improve performance. Overall, decision trees are handy for various tasks, from predicting categories to numerical values, in fields like finance, healthcare, and marketing. Creates best fitting outcomes using different sets of tests and questions that categorizes it into the best fitting category. "
