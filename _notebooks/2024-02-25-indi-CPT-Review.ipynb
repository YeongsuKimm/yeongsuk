    "## Project Summary\n",
    "> Within the last decade, video sharing platforms have become immensely popular all around the world, allowing users to watch, interact with, and upload videos. With this in mind, we created our very own video sharing platform. This allows users to create their own accounts and upload or stream videos!\n",

    "## My Feature\n",
    "> My feature is the video page that displays the video, video title, video description, uploader, and views. An additional feature I worked on was the genres and search feature that allows users to filter all the videos based on a preferred genre. \n",
